Problem Description:

Write a Java program that reads a CV file containing a list of bank transactions and performs the following operations:
	1. Read the CSV file and create a list of "Product' objects, where each object represents a product in the file.
	2. Filter the list of products to include only those with a price greater than a specified value.
	3. Group the products by category and calculate the total value of products in each category.
	4. Calculate the average price of all products in the list.
	5. Find the product with the highest price in the list.
	6. The public methods service class ProductService.java has method skeletons, that you need to update to fulfill above expectations

Your implementation should conform to the following requirements:
	1. The program should use Exception Handling to handle any potential errors during file reading or transaction processing.
	2. The program should use the "CsvToBean" class from the 'opencsv'" library to read the CSV file.
	3. The program should use appropriate exception handling techniques, such as try-catch blocks, to catch and handle any exceptions that may occur.
	4. The program should have a clean and user-friendly interface.

Your task is to complete the methods defined in the file below:
	1. ../src/main/java/com/tasks/problem/Product.java
	2  ../src/main/java/com/tasks/problem/ProductService.java
	
Notes:
	1. Ensure that the structure and datatype of the components are followed as specified in the comments to ensure that the code is evaluated correctly.
	2. You can add a helper method in the same service class or a helper class in the same/other package.
