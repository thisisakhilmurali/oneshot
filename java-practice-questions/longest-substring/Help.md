Task Description:
You are given a string str, find the length of the longest substring in str without repeating characters. Implement an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n).

Example:
Let the given string be “ABDEFGABEF”, the longest substrings without repeating characters here are “BDEFGA” and “DEFGAB”, with length 6. Similarly, for “BBBB” the longest substring is “B”, with length 1.

Your task is to complete the helper methods defined in the file below:
1. ../src/main/java/com/tasks/problem/LongestSubstring.java

Notes:
1. Ensure that the structure and datatype of the components are followed as specified in the comments to ensure that the code is evaluated correctly.
